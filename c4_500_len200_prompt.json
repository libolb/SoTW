Baalbaki has no work of his own in this show.\nBorn in Safad, northern Palestine, around 1888-1890, Abbo was a farmer and fisherman who later took up carpentry and stone masonry. It was not until he moved to Berlin in 1911 to study sculpture that his artistic career took shape.\nBaalbaki has spent the last four years finding, and determining attribution for, 70 artworks and 100 texts mentioning the artist.\nBaalbaki says many of Abbo's sculptures didn't survive World War I. He believes those that were originally exhibited in museums in Germany were taken during the war and melted down to make weapons.\nAlongside Abbo's artworks are vintage photos of places he'd been or postcards from that time period, which Baalbaki says is to give an overall look at the life he led, in today's age of media and imagery.\nBaalbaki intends to continue his research and tracking down Abbo's works.",

No, not the serious one that HBO is doing with Elizabeth Banks and Paul Giamatti, and not the overtly comedic one that Will Ferrell is set to star in. It’s Battle Of The Sexes, the middle one that’s supposed to be a comedy with “dramatic and political overtones”—as we said in an earlier report. Battle Of The Sexes comes from Little Miss Sunshine’s Jonathan Dayton and Valerie Faris, and it was set to star Emma Stone and Steve Carell as the eponymous sexes. Now, Stone has backed out due to “a scheduling conflict,” and the studio is reportedly in talks with Brie Larson to replace her.\nLarson recently appeared in Room, a film that is not only making some waves in the film festival circuit but also has a name that’s very similar to a certain other movie, which could end up causing a reverse-Asylum by tricking people who want to see a bad movie into seeing a good movie.

Then the designers silkscreen their bold, original images onto 51-inch silk squares. Often modeled like modernist capes, they could just as easily be hung on a wall as colorful tapestries.\nThe collection is available in concept stores and high-end boutiques in Paris, Tokyo, Berlin, New York, Madrid, and Copenhagen, with prices starting at about $250.",

Whatever our circumstances, job or no job, older or newly minted, injured from work or genetics, embracing or rejecting interventionist medicine, we all need access to quality medical choices. Obama’s Affordable Care Act was revolutionary in making health care available. Hillary Clinton will protect it, possibly even upgrade it. Don’t destroy this opportunity.\nHillary has in-depth knowledge about insurance. When she was first lady, she fought to help pass health-care reform. She created a Children’s Health Insurance Program and cut the uninsured rate of American children by half. Today it provides health care to more than 8 million kids. Politics isn’t just about power and money games, politics can be about the improvement of people’s lives and the lessening of human suffering.\nHillary believes, like most Democrats, that quality, affordable health care is a basic human right. Her strategy for affordable health care approaches the issue of cost from many different roads, including tax credits for excessive medical costs, a “public purchase option” to reduce costs, a critical examination of the cost of prescription drugs and improvement in the efficient provision of medical services. Her work as a senator and first lady has given her a sensitivity to the negotiations needed to make policy changes.\nVote for your health options. Vote for Hillary in the April 26 primary.",

He wanted to cap his long career with a final haggle this one with the Taliban themselves, leading to a peace conference celebrating the 10th anniversary of the Bonn accord, which established the Karzai government in December 2001. He was at odds with Petraeus about that. The general was looking for something closer to a surrender than a negotiation from the Taliban, and his remains the default position in the Obama Administration. Holbrooke was also skeptical about the efficacy of maintaining a large U.S. force in Afghanistan, although he was curious about what sort of progress I'd find when I visited the Taliban heartland in December.

Both were convinced that there would never be real stability in Afghanistan until a strong agricultural economy returned. Having lost his faith in the Karzai administration, Holbrooke hoped a credible government could emerge from the bottom up, from local shuras like the one in Zhari that Eikenberry met with, from a rural populace that had moved on from poppies a funding source for both the Taliban and Karzai's friends to pomegranates and wheat.",

In this study we investigate the influence of process interactions on quantitative estimates of erosion rates based on sediment transport and accumulation. Sediment characteristics were measured on talus fan and stream channel deposits. These observations were used to evaluate weathering and rounding, which can indicate transport history and mixing between the two deposits and processes. Talus fans were studied to quantify the stability of fan surfaces and determine the frequency of material transport. Streams were studied to determine the efficiency of meltwater flow to move sand and coarser materials deposited on talus surfaces. Similarities between sediments in the fluvial and talus deposits support strong coupling between these processes. Streams are capable of moving smaller sized talus materials, however active rockfalls continue to supply new sediment and limit stream incision. The source of recent rockfalls appears to be ridges at high elevations or along north facing walls indicated by the frequency of surface weathering and lichen cover on selected talus fans.\nTranel, Lisa M.; Ritchie, Amber; and Strow, Meredith (2011) \"Investigation of Postglacial Sediment Storage and Transport in Garnet Canyon, Teton Range, Wyoming,\" University of Wyoming National Park Service Research Center Annual Report: Vol. 34 , Article 23.",

That’s not to say that all claims made by barefoot advocates are false. But it does mean that you’re right to question whether barefoot running is right for you.\nAdding to this body of knowledge is a study out of Brigham Young University that tracked the health of feet making the transition from running in shoes to minimalist footwear (Vibram Five Fingers).\nThirty-six experienced recreational runners had scans of their feet and lower limbs before and after the 10 week experiment that split the group into two; a control group that kept running in traditional footwear and the experimental group that slowly transitioned (one mile per week for three weeks) to Vibrams.\nThe first set of scans showed no difference between both sets of runners. The second scan however showed a greater incidence of injury in the feet of Vibram wearers than in the shod runners.\nThe authors went on to suggest that runners wishing to transition to minimalist shoes, do so over a time frame longer than 10 weeks and ease into the footwear slower than the guidelines recommended by Vibram footwear manufacturers. Good advice for anyone switching from traditional running shoes to any minimalist shoe on the market.",

Sure, shares in the bankrupt coal company Peabody soared nearly 50 percent the day after Trump’s victory. But that’s just Wall Street’s knee-jerk response. The fact is, the coal industry’s future is — at best — flat, according to analysts.\nOver the last eight years, coal’s portion of the American electricity supply has dropped from half to a third, a result of falling natural gas prices, declining demand from China, and regulatory efforts to reduce carbon emissions. The best Trump can do, says Bloomberg News, is halt coal’s steep decline.\nBut even though Trump can’t save Big Coal, he can severely damage the planet by enabling the industry. He has promised to dismantle the Clean Power Plan, ignore the Paris climate agreement, and end investments in renewables. Just as coal can’t be revived, the planet can’t either.\nThe farmers who voted for Trump may be in for disappointment.\nObama’s Interior makes it easier to build renewable energy on public land in Trump era.",

Traditional farmhouse examples, such as Montgomery’s and Keen’s, are still made from raw cows’ milk and matured for up to 18 months, giving them a dry, flaky texture and a rich, tangy, often nutty character. Mass-produced examples tend to be aged for much shorter periods, and will have a creamier, moister texture and a milder flavour, but generally melt better when cooked.\nA mixture of vegetarian and animal rennets are used, depending on the producer. Cheddar is traditionally made from slabs of curd that are stacked on top of each other, and turned frequently. The pressure of their combined weight squeezes out any remaining whey; the slabs can then be cut into small pieces, salted, and put into moulds for maturing. This process is known as ‘Cheddaring’.\nCheddar comes in a wide variety of styles, from young and fresh to mature and crumbly. Cheeses labelled as West Country Cheddar must be made from cows reared in Cornwall, Devon, Dorset or Somerset using traditional methods. They must contain no colourings, flavourings of preservatives, and must have been matured on the farm where they were made for at least nine months.",

You’re not welcome here, white boy!” Nicki Minaj squawked with the flip of her hand. OK, so we just totally made that part up. But we’d give the show way more credit if they’d let a truth bomb like that slip through every once in a while.\nSpeaking of truth bombs, mentor Jimmy Iovine ripped the judges (and some poor lowly production intern) a new a-hole during the night when he called them out for “coddling” the contestants and being too nice.\nAlso rounding out the results show were performances by past American Idol also-rans Casey Abrams and Jessica Sanchez, featuring Ne-Yo.",

In his letter to Berkshire shareholders last month, he called the equity participation a \"bonus.\"\nBack on September 23, the day Buffett's multi-billion dollar \"vote of confidence\" in Goldman was announced, shares of the firm closed at $125.05.
